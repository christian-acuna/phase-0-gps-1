- What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

  Prior to the GPS, I was confused about git fetch and merge along with how to resolve a merge conflict. I also was unsure of the difference between git -a and -A.

- What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

  How to use Git fetch and merge was clarified during the GPS. Also, how to resolve a merge conflict was made clear during our session.

- What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

  What is git fetch?
  What is the difference between -a and -A?


- What still confuses you about Git?

  Git rebase and git revert are still confusing to me, but not essential at this point.

- How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

  Although there was no pair from my cohort, I really enjoyed pairing with my GPS. Being the driver for the whole session really solidified the commands and git workflow. Initially, I was nervous about remote pairing but found it to be really enjoyable and I learned a lot. I look forward to my next pairing session.
